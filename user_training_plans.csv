PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Hyperextensions (Back Extensions),beginner,lower back,Lie face down on a hyperextension bench tucking your ankles securely under the footpads. Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction. With your body straight cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Child's Pose,beginner,lower back,"Get on your hands and knees walk your hands in front of you. Lower your buttocks down to sit on your heels. Let your arms drag along the floor as you sit back to stretch your entire spine. Once you settle onto your heels bring your hands next to your feet and relax. ""breathe"" into your back. Rest your forehead on the floor. Avoid this position if you have knee problems."
PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Standing Pelvic Tilt,beginner,lower back,Start off with your feet hip-distance apart. Bend your knees slightly to keep them soft and springy. You may want to move your pelvis forward and backward and back few times before holding the tailbone forward in this stretch.
PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Stiff Leg Barbell Good Morning,beginner,lower back,This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. Keeping your legs stationary move your torso forward by bending at the hips while inhaling. Lower your torso until it is parallel with the floor. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by elevating your torso back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
