Slowly raise the dumbbells straight up until they are slightly above your shoulders while keeping your elbows locked.

Select the weight to be used on each pulley. Now sit at the edge of the flat bench behind you with your feet placed in front of your knees. Bend forward while keeping your back flat and rest your torso on the thighs. Have someone give you the single handles attached to the pulleys. Grasp the left pulley with the right hand and the right pulley with the left after you select your weight. The pulleys should run under your knees and your arms will be extended with palms facing each other and a slight bend at the elbows. This will be the starting position. While keeping the arms stationary raise the upper arms to the sides until they are parallel to the floor and at shoulder height. Exhale during the execution of this movement and hold the contraction for a second. Slowly lower your arms to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Tip: Maintain upper arms perpendicular to torso and a fixed elbow position (10 degree to 30 degree angle) throughout exercise.

PinaG,,Friday,Barbell Rear Delt Row,beginner,shoulders,"Stand up straight while holding a barbell using a wide (higher than shoulder width) and overhand (palms facing your body) grip. Bend knees slightly and bend over as you keep the natural arch of your back. Let the arms hang in front of you as they hold the bar. Once your torso is parallel to the floor flare the elbows out and away from your body. Tip: Your torso and your arms should resemble the letter ""T"". Now you are ready to begin the exercise. While keeping the upper arms perpendicular to the torso pull the barbell up towards your upper chest as you squeeze the rear delts and you breathe out. Tip: When performed correctly this exercise should resemble a bench press in reverse. Also refrain from using your biceps to do the work. Focus on targeting the rear delts; the arms should only act as hooks. Slowly go back to the initial position as you breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
