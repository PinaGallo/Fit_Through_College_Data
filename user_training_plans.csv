PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Ankle On The Knee,beginner,glutes,From a lying position bend your knees and keep your feet on the floor. Place your ankle of one foot on your opposite knee. Grasp the thigh or knee of the bottom leg and pull both of your legs into the chest. Relax your neck and shoulders. Hold for 10-20 seconds and then switch sides.
PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Single Leg Glute Bridge,beginner,glutes,Lay on the floor with your feet flat and knees bent. Raise one leg off of the ground pulling the knee to your chest. This will be your starting position. Execute the movement by driving through the heel extending your hip upward and raising your glutes off of the ground. Extend as far as possible pause and then return to the starting position.
PinaG,2024-05-15,Saturday,Glute Kickback,beginner,glutes,Kneel on the floor or an exercise mat and bend at the waist with your arms extended in front of you (perpendicular to the torso) in order to get into a kneeling push-up position but with the arms spaced at shoulder width. Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position. As you exhale lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it. Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg. Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.

Hold under the knee joint to protect the kneecap. Gently tug that knee toward your nose. Switch sides. This stretches the buttocks and lower back of the bent leg and the hip flexor of the straight leg.

Place your left arm comfortably beside you and turn your head to the left. Imagine you have a weight tied to your tailbone. let your tailbone fall back toward the floor as your chest reaches in the opposite direction to stretch your lower back. Switch sides."
