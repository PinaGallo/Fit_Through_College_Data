With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement the arms and torso should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.

PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,JM Press,beginner,triceps,Start the exercise the same way you would a close grip bench press. You will lie on a flat bench while holding a barbell at arms length (fully extended) with the elbows in. However instead of having the arms perpendicular to the torso make sure the bar is set in a direct line above the upper chest. This will be your starting position. Now beginning from a fully extended position lower the bar down as if performing a lying triceps extension. Inhale as you perform this movement. When you reach the half way point let the bar roll back about one inch by moving the upper arms towards your legs until they are perpendicular to the torso. Tip: Keep the bend at the elbows constant as you bring the upper arms forward. As you exhale press the bar back up by using the triceps to perform a close grip bench press.

Once at shoulder width keep the palms of your hands with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Keep your elbows flared out with the upper arms in line with the shoulders (perpendicular to the torso) and the elbows bent creating a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. This will be your starting position. Now bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. As you breathe out push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done place the dumbbells back in your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to dispose of the dumbbells.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,Incline Dumbbell Flyes,beginner,chest,Hold a dumbbell on each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees.

This will be your starting position. As you breathe in start to slowly lower the arms to the side while keeping the arms extended and while rotating the wrists until the palms of the hand are facing each other. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be by your side with the palms facing the ceiling. As you exhale start to bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and rotating the hands so that the pinky fingers are next to each other again.

Position your elbows so that they are bent at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are perpendicular (90 degree angle) to your torso. Tip: Keep the elbows in and make sure that the upper arms point to the ceiling while your forearms point towards the pulley above your head. This will be your starting position. As you breathe out extend your lower arms until they are straight and vertical. The upper arms and elbows remain stationary throughout the movement. Only the forearms should move. Contract the triceps hard for a second. As you breathe in slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment,beginner,triceps,Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position. Using the triceps bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After holding for a second at the contracted position bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
