Maximus,2024-05-01,Wednesday,Leg Extensions,beginner,quadriceps,For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle. Using your quadriceps extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position. Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit. Repeat for the recommended amount of times.
Maximus,2024-05-01,Wednesday,Hip Flexion with Band,beginner,quadriceps,Secure one end of the band to the lower portion of a post and attach the other to one ankle. Face away from the attachment point of the band. Keeping your head and your chest up raise your knee up to 90 degrees and pause. Return the leg to the starting position.
Maximus,2024-05-01,Wednesday,Mountain Climbers,beginner,quadriceps,Begin in a pushup position with your weight supported by your hands and toes. Flexing the knee and hip bring one leg until the knee is approximately under the hip. This will be your starting position. Explosively reverse the positions of your legs extending the bent leg until the leg is straight and supported by the toe and bringing the other foot up with the hip and knee flexed. Repeat in an alternating fashion for 20-30 seconds.
Maximus,2024-05-01,Wednesday,Cable Deadlifts,beginner,quadriceps,Move the cables to the bottom of the towers and select an appropriate weight. Stand directly in between the uprights. To begin squat down be flexing your hips and knees until you can reach the handles. After grasping them begin your ascent. Driving through your heels extend your hips and knees keeping your hands hanging at your side. Keep your head and chest up throughout the movement. After reaching a full standing position Return to the starting position and repeat.
Maximus,2024-05-01,Wednesday,Single-Leg Leg Extension,beginner,quadriceps,Seat yourself in the machine and adjust it so that you are positioned properly. The pad should be against the lower part of the shin but not in contact with the ankle. Adjust the seat so that the pivot point is in line with your knee. Select a weight appropriate for your abilities. Maintaining good posture fully extend one leg pausing at the top of the motion. Return to the starting position without letting the weight stop keeping tension on the muscle. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
