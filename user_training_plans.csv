Your knees can rest on the seat or your legs can be straddled to the sides (my preferred way). Let your arms extend and hang naturally in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the floor. Now keep your elbows in by your side and face the palms forward. This will be your starting position. Raise the dumbbells by contracting the biceps until your arms are fully flexed. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and ensure that only the forearms move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Lower the dumbbells until your arms are fully extended. Repeat for the recommended amount of times.

A supinated grip closer than shoulder width is needed to perform this exercise. Tip: Your arm should be extended at arms length and the barbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arms stationary curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Slowly begin to bring the barbell back to starting position as your breathe in. Tip: Avoid swinging motions at any time. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

This will allow you to keep your balance. Slowly begin to curl the single handle upwards while keeping the upper arm stationary until your forearm touches your bicep while exhaling. Tip: Only the forearm should move. Hold the contraction position as you squeeze the bicep and then lower the single handle back down to the starting position as you inhale.
