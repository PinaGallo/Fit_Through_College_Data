Nadine,2024-05-27,Monday,Cable Seated Crunch,beginner,abdominals,Seat on a flat bench with your back facing a high pulley. Grasp the cable rope attachment with both hands (with the palms of the hands facing each other) and place your hands securely over both shoulders. Tip: Allow the weight to hyperextend the lower back slightly. This will be your starting position. With the hips stationary flex the waist so the elbows travel toward the hips. Breathe out as you perform this step. As you inhale go back to the initial position slowly. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
Nadine,2024-05-27,Monday,Air Bike,beginner,abdominals,Lie flat on the floor with your lower back pressed to the ground. For this exercise you will need to put your hands beside your head. Be careful however to not strain with the neck as you perform it. Now lift your shoulders into the crunch position. Bring knees up to where they are perpendicular to the floor with your lower legs parallel to the floor. This will be your starting position. Now simultaneously slowly go through a cycle pedal motion kicking forward with the right leg and bringing in the knee of the left leg. Bring your right elbow close to your left knee by crunching to the side as you breathe out. Go back to the initial position as you breathe in. Crunch to the opposite side as you cycle your legs and bring closer your left elbow to your right knee and exhale. Continue alternating in this manner until all of the recommended repetitions for each side have been completed.
Nadine,2024-05-27,Monday,Decline Reverse Crunch,beginner,abdominals,"""Lie on your back on a decline bench and hold on to the top of the bench with both hands. Dont let your body slip down from this position."" Hold your legs parallel to the floor using your abs to hold them there while keeping your knees and feet together. Tip: Your legs should be fully extended with a slight bend on the knee. This will be your starting position. While exhaling move your legs towards the torso as you roll your pelvis backwards and you raise your hips off the bench. At the end of this movement your knees will be touching your chest. Hold the contraction for a second and move your legs back to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
Nadine,2024-05-27,Monday,Pallof Press With Rotation,beginner,abdominals,"Connect a standard handle to a tower and position the cable to shoulder height. ""With your side to the cable grab the handle with one hand and step away from the tower. You should be approximately arms length away from the pulley with the tension of the weight on the cable. Align outstretched arm with cable."" With your feet positioned hip-width apart pull the cable into your chest and grab the handle with your other hand. Both hands should be on the handle at this time. Facing forward press the cable away from your chest. You core should be tight and engaged. Keeping your hips straight twist your torso away from the pulley until you get a full quarter rotation. Maintain your rigid stance and straight arms. Return to the neutral position in a slow and controlled manner. Your arms should be extended in front of you. With the side tension still engaging your core bring your hands to your chest and immediately press outward to a fully extended position. This constitutes one rep. Repeat to failure. Then reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side."
Nadine,2024-05-27,Monday,Exercise Ball Crunch,beginner,abdominals,Lie on an exercise ball with your lower back curvature pressed against the spherical surface of the ball. Your feet should be bent at the knee and pressed firmly against the floor. The upper torso should be hanging off the top of the ball. The arms should either be kept alongside the body or crossed on top of your chest as these positions avoid neck strains (as opposed to the hands behind the back of the head position). Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position. With the hips stationary flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second. As you inhale go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
