PinaG,2024-06-18,Wednesday,Rack Pull with Bands,intermediate,lower back,Set up in a power rack with the bar on the pins. The pins should be set to the desired point; just below the knees just above or in the mid thigh position. Attach bands to the base of the rack or secure them with dumbbells. Attach the other end to the bar. You may need to choke the bands to provide tension. Position yourself against the bar in proper deadlifting position. Your feet should be under your hips your grip shoulder width back arched and hips back to engage the hamstrings. Since the weight is typically heavy you may use a mixed grip a hook grip or use straps to aid in holding the weight. With your head looking forward extend through the hips and knees pulling the weight up and back until lockout. Be sure to pull your shoulders back as you complete the movement. Return the weight to the pins and repeat.
PinaG,2024-06-18,Wednesday,Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench,intermediate,lower back,With someone holding down your legs slide yourself down to the edge a flat bench until your hips hang off the end of the bench. Tip: Your entire upper body should be hanging down towards the floor. Also you will be in the same position as if you were on a hyperextension bench but the range of motion will be shorter due to the height of the flat bench vs. that of the hyperextension bench. With your body straight cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you almost touch the floor or you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings (whichever comes first). Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you exhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-18,Wednesday,Deficit Deadlift,intermediate,lower back,Begin by having a platform or weight plates that you can stand on usually 1-3 inches in height. Approach the bar so that it is centered over your feet. You feet should be about hip width apart. Bend at the hip to grip the bar at shoulder width allowing your shoulder blades to protract. Typically you would use an overhand grip or an over/under grip on heavier sets. With your feet and your grip set take a big breath and then lower your hips and bend the knees until your shins contact the bar. Look forward with your head keep your chest up and your back arched and begin driving through the heels to move the weight upward. After the bar passes the knees aggressively pull the bar back pulling your shoulder blades together as you drive your hips forward into the bar. Lower the bar by bending at the hips and guiding it to the floor.

PinaG,2024-06-18,Wednesday,Atlas Stone Trainer,intermediate,lower back,"""This trainer is effective for developing Atlas Stone strength for those who dont have access to stones and are typically made from bar ends or heavy pipe."" Begin by loading the desired weight onto the bar. Straddle the weight wrapping your arms around the implement bending at the hips. Begin by pulling the weight up past the knees extending through the hips. As the weight clears the knees it can be lapped by resting it on your thighs and sitting back hugging it tightly to your chest. Finish the movement by extending through your hips and knees to raise the weight as high as possible. The weight can be returned to the lap or to the ground for successive repetitions."

Begin by stepping under the bar and placing it across the back of the shoulders not on top of your traps. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and rotate your elbows forward attempting to bend the bar across your shoulders. Remove the bar from the rack creating a tight arch in your lower back. Keep your head facing forward. With your back shoulders and core tight push your knees and butt out and you begin your descent. Sit back with your hips until you are seated on the box. This will be your starting position. Keeping the bar tight bend forward at the hips as much as possible. If you set the pins to what would be parallel you not only have a safety if you fail but know when to stop. Pause just above the pins and reverse the motion until your torso it upright.
