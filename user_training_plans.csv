PinaG,2024-05-05,Friday,Piriformis-SMR,intermediate,glutes,Sit with your buttocks on top of a foam roll. Bend your knees and then cross one leg so that the ankle is over the knee. This will be your starting position. Shift your weight to the side of the crossed leg rolling over the buttocks until you feel tension in your upper glute. You may assist the stretch by using one hand to pull the bent knee towards your chest. Hold this position for 10-30 seconds and then switch sides.
PinaG,2024-05-05,Friday,One-Legged Cable Kickback,intermediate,glutes,"Hook a leather ankle cuff to a low cable pulley and then attach the cuff to your ankle. Face the weight stack from a distance of about two feet grasping the steel frame for support. While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight contract your glutes to slowly ""kick"" the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction. Now slowly bring your working leg forward resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch legs and repeat the movement for the other side."
