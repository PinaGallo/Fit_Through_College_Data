PinaG,2024-05-21,Tuesday,Supine Two-Arm Overhead Throw,beginner,abdominals,Lay on the ground on your back with your knees bent. Hold the ball with both hands extending the arms fully behind your head. This will be your starting position. Initiate the movement at the shoulder throwing the ball directly forward of you as you sit up attempting to go for maximum distance. The ball can be thrown to a partner or bounced off of a wall.
PinaG,2024-05-21,Tuesday,Exercise Ball Pull-In,beginner,abdominals,Place an exercise ball nearby and lay on the floor in front of it with your hands on the floor shoulder width apart in a push-up position. Now place your lower shins on top of an exercise ball. Tip: At this point your legs should be fully extended with the shins on top of the ball and the upper body should be in a push-up type of position being supported by your two extended arms in front of you. This will be your starting position. While keeping your back completely straight and the upper body stationary pull your knees in towards your chest as you exhale allowing the ball to roll forward under your ankles. Squeeze your abs and hold that position for a second. Now slowly straighten your legs rolling the ball back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-21,Tuesday,Medicine Ball Full Twist,beginner,abdominals,For this exercise you will need a medicine ball and a partner. Stand back to back with your partner spaced 2-3 feet apart. This will be your starting position. Hold the ball in front of the trunk. Open the hips and turn the shoulders at the same time as your partner. For full rotation you and your partner should twist in the same direction i.e. counter-clockwise. Pass the ball to your partner and both of you can now twist in the opposite direction to repeat the procedure.
PinaG,2024-05-21,Tuesday,Oblique Crunches - On The Floor,beginner,abdominals,Start out by lying on your right side with your legs lying on top of each other. Make sure your knees are bent a little bit. Place your left hand behind your head. Once you are in this set position begin by moving your left elbow up as you would perform a normal crunch except this time the main emphasis is on your obliques. Crunch as high as you can hold the contraction for a second and then slowly drop back down into the starting position. Remember to breathe in during the eccentric (lowering) part of the exercise and to breathe out during the concentric (elevation) part of the exercise.
