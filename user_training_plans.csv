Extend as far as possible then reverse the motion to return to the starting position.
PinaG,2024-05-16,Sunday,One-Legged Cable Kickback,intermediate,glutes,"Hook a leather ankle cuff to a low cable pulley and then attach the cuff to your ankle. Face the weight stack from a distance of about two feet grasping the steel frame for support. While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight contract your glutes to slowly ""kick"" the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction. Now slowly bring your working leg forward resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch legs and repeat the movement for the other side."

PinaG,2024-05-16,Sunday,Barbell Hip Thrust,intermediate,glutes,Begin seated on the ground with a bench directly behind you. Have a loaded barbell over your legs. Using a fat bar or having a pad on the bar can greatly reduce the discomfort caused by this exercise. Roll the bar so that it is directly above your hips and lean back against the bench so that your shoulder blades are near the top of it. Begin the movement by driving through your feet extending your hips vertically through the bar. Your weight should be supported by your shoulder blades and your feet.

PinaG,2024-05-19,Sunday,Freehand Jump Squat,intermediate,quadriceps,Cross your arms over your chest. With your head up and your back straight position your feet at shoulder width. Keeping your back straight and chest up squat down as you inhale until your upper thighs are parallel or lower to the floor. Now pressing mainly with the ball of your feet jump straight up in the air as high as possible using the thighs like springs. Exhale during this portion of the movement. When you touch the floor again immediately squat down and jump again. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-19,Sunday,Front Squat (Clean Grip),intermediate,quadriceps,To begin first set the bar in a rack slightly below shoulder level. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids pushing into the clavicles and lightly touching the throat. Your hands should be in a clean grip touching the bar only with your fingers to help keep it in position. Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head and elbows up at all times. This will be your starting position. Bend at the knees sitting down between your legs. Continue down until your hamstrings are on your calves. Keep your knees aligned with your feet by consciously using your abductors to push your knees out as you squat. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel or middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and return to the starting position.
PinaG,2024-05-19,Sunday,Zottman Preacher Curl,intermediate,biceps,Grab a dumbbell in each hand and place your upper arms on top of the preacher bench or the incline bench. The dumbbells should be held at shoulder height and the elbows should be flexed. Hold the dumbbells with the palms of your hands facing down. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in slowly lower the dumbbells keeping the palms down until your upper arm is extended and your biceps are fully stretched. Now rotate your wrists once you are at the bottom of the movement so that the palms of the hands are facing up. As you exhale use your biceps to curl the weights up until they are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder height. Again remember that to ensure full contraction you need to bring that small finger higher than the thumb. Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and rotate your wrists so that the palms are facing down again. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-19,Sunday,Dumbbell Prone Incline Curl,intermediate,biceps,Grab a dumbbell on each hand and lie face down on an incline bench with your shoulders near top of the incline.

Now keep your elbows in by your side and face the palms forward. This will be your starting position. Raise the dumbbells by contracting the biceps until your arms are fully flexed. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and ensure that only the forearms move. The upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Lower the dumbbells until your arms are fully extended. Repeat for the recommended amount of times.
PinaG,2024-05-19,Sunday,Rope Jumping,intermediate,quadriceps,Hold an end of the rope in each hand. Position the rope behind you on the ground. Raise your arms up and turn the rope over your head bringing it down in front of you. When it reaches the ground jump over it. Find a good turning pace that can be maintained. Different speeds and techniques can be used to introduce variation. Rope jumping is exciting challenges your coordination and requires a lot of energy.
