PinaG,2024-06-01,Wednesday,Hyperextensions With No Hyperextension Bench,intermediate,lower back,With someone holding down your legs slide yourself down to the edge a flat bench until your hips hang off the end of the bench. Tip: Your entire upper body should be hanging down towards the floor. Also you will be in the same position as if you were on a hyperextension bench but the range of motion will be shorter due to the height of the flat bench vs. that of the hyperextension bench. With your body straight cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you almost touch the floor or you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings (whichever comes first). Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you exhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Wednesday,Keg Load,intermediate,lower back,To load kegs place the desired number a distance from the loading platform typically 30-50 feet. Begin by grabbing the close handle of the first keg tilting it onto its side to grab the opposite edge of the bottom of the keg. Lift the keg up to your chest. The higher you can place the keg the faster you should be able to move to the platform. Shouldering is usually not allowed. Be sure to keep a firm hold on the keg. Move as quickly as possible to the platform and load it extending through your hips knees and ankles to get it as high as possible. Return to the starting position to retrieve the next keg and repeat until the event is completed.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Wednesday,Crossover Reverse Lunge,intermediate,lower back,Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position. Perform a rear lunge by stepping back with one foot and flexing the hips and front knee. As you do so rotate your torso across the front leg. After a brief pause return to the starting position and repeat on the other side continuing in an alternating fashion.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Wednesday,Barbell Deadlift,intermediate,lower back,Stand in front of a loaded barbell. While keeping the back as straight as possible bend your knees bend forward and grasp the bar using a medium (shoulder width) overhand grip. This will be the starting position of the exercise. Tip: If it is difficult to hold on to the bar with this grip alternate your grip or use wrist straps. While holding the bar start the lift by pushing with your legs while simultaneously getting your torso to the upright position as you breathe out. In the upright position stick your chest out and contract the back by bringing the shoulder blades back. Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention. Go back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight. When the weights on the bar touch the floor you are back at the starting position and ready to perform another repetition. Perform the amount of repetitions prescribed in the program.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Wednesday,Pelvic Tilt Into Bridge,intermediate,lower back,"Lie down with your feet on the floor heels directly under your knees. ""Lift only your tailbone to the ceiling to stretch your lower back. (Dont lift the entire spine yet.) Pull in your stomach."" To go into a bridge lift the entire spine except the neck."
