PinaG,2024-05-30,Saturday,Sandbag Load,beginner,quadriceps,"To load sandbags or other objects begin with the implements placed a distance from the loading platform typically 50 feet. Begin by lifting the sandbag. Sandbags are extremely awkward and the manner of lifting them can vary depending on the particular sandbag used. Reach as far around it as possible extending through the hips and knees to pull it up high. Shouldering is usually not allowed. ""Move as quickly as possible to the platform and load it extending through your hips knees and ankles to get it as high as possible. Place it onto the platform ensuring it doesnt fall off."" Return to the starting position to retrieve the next sandbag and repeat until the event is completed."
PinaG,2024-05-30,Saturday,Leg Extensions,beginner,quadriceps,For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle. Using your quadriceps extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position. Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit. Repeat for the recommended amount of times.
PinaG,2024-05-30,Saturday,Single-Leg Stride Jump,beginner,quadriceps,Stand to the side of a box with your inside foot on top of it close to the edge. Begin by swinging the arms upward as you push through the top leg jumping upward as high as possible. Attempt to drive the opposite knee upward. Land in the same position that you started using your inside leg to decelerate the impact.
PinaG,2024-05-30,Saturday,Bear Crawl Sled Drags,beginner,quadriceps,Wearing either a harness or a loose weight belt attach the chain to the back so that you will be facing away from the sled. Bend down so that your hands are on the ground. Your back should be flat and knees bent. This is your starting position. Begin by driving with legs alternating left and right. Use your hands to maintain balance and to help pull. Try to keep your back flat as you move over a given distance.
PinaG,2024-05-30,Saturday,Mountain Climbers,beginner,quadriceps,Begin in a pushup position with your weight supported by your hands and toes. Flexing the knee and hip bring one leg until the knee is approximately under the hip. This will be your starting position. Explosively reverse the positions of your legs extending the bent leg until the leg is straight and supported by the toe and bringing the other foot up with the hip and knee flexed. Repeat in an alternating fashion for 20-30 seconds.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Wednesday,Recumbent Bike,beginner,quadriceps,To begin seat yourself on the bike and adjust the seat to your height. Select the desired option from the menu. You may have to start pedaling to turn it on. You can use the manual setting or you can select a program to use. Typically you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. The level of resistance can be changed throughout the workout. The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity. Recumbent bikes offer convenience cardiovascular benefits and have less impact than other activities. A 150 lb person will burn about 230 calories cycling at a moderate rate for 30 minutes compared to 450 calories or more running.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Wednesday,Smith Machine Squat,beginner,quadriceps,To begin first set the bar on the height that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side (palms facing forward) unlock it and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section). Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Wednesday,Alternate Leg Diagonal Bound,beginner,quadriceps,Assume a comfortable stance with one foot slightly in front of the other. Begin by pushing off with the front leg driving the opposite knee forward and as high as possible before landing. Attempt to cover as much distance to each side with each bound. It may help to use a line on the ground to guage distance from side to side. Repeat the sequence with the other leg.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Wednesday,Bodyweight Squat,beginner,quadriceps,Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. You can place your hands behind your head. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by flexing your knees and hips sitting back with your hips. Continue down to full depth if you are ableand quickly reverse the motion until you return to the starting position. As you squat keep your head and chest up and push your knees out.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Wednesday,Barbell Walking Lunge,beginner,quadriceps,Begin standing with your feet shoulder width apart and a barbell across your upper back. Step forward with one leg flexing the knees to drop your hips. Descend until your rear knee nearly touches the ground. Your posture should remain upright and your front knee should stay above the front foot. Drive through the heel of your lead foot and extend both knees to raise yourself back up. Step forward with your rear foot repeating the lunge on the opposite leg.
