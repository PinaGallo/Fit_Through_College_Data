PinaG,2024-05-26,Saturday,Smith Machine Decline Press,beginner,chest,Position a decline bench in the rack so that the bar will be above your chest. Load an appropriate weight and take your place on the bench. Rotate the bar to unhook it from the rack and fully extend your arms. Your back should be slightly arched and your shoulder blades retracted. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by flexing your arms lowering the bar to your chest. Pause briefly and then extend your arms to push the weight back to the starting position. After completing the desired number of repetitions rotate the bar to rack the weight.
PinaG,2024-05-26,Saturday,Machine Bench Press,beginner,chest,Sit down on the Chest Press Machine and select the weight. Step on the lever provided by the machine since it will help you to bring the handles forward so that you can grab the handles and fully extend the arms. Grab the handles with a palms-down grip and lift your elbows so that your upper arms are parallel to the floor to the sides of your torso. Tip: Your forearms will be pointing forward since you are grabbing the handles. Once you bring the handles forward and extend the arms you will be at the starting position. Now bring the handles back towards you as you breathe in. Push the handles away from you as you flex your pecs and you breathe out. Hold the contraction for a second before going back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of reps. When finished step on the lever again and slowly get the handles back to their original place.
PinaG,2024-05-26,Saturday,One Arm Dumbbell Bench Press,beginner,chest,Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in one hand on top of your thigh. By using your thigh to help you get the dumbbell up clean the dumbbell up so that you can hold it in front of you at shoulder width. Use the hand you are not lifting with to help position the dumbbell over you properly. Once at shoulder width rotate your wrist forward so that the palm of your hand is facing away from you. This will be your starting position. Bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbell at all times. Tip: Use the hand that you are not lifting with to help keep the dumbbell balance as you may struggle a bit at first. Only use your non-lifting hand if it is needed. Otherwise keep it resting to the side. As you breathe out push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position squeeze your chest hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program. Switch arms and repeat the movement.

While facing away from the post grab the handles on both ends of the band and step forward enough to create tension on the band. Raise your arms to the sides parallel to the floor perpendicular to your torso (your torso and the arms should resemble the letter ""T"") and with the palms facing forward. Have them extended with a slight bend at the elbows. This will be your starting position. While keeping your arms straight bring them across your chest in a semicircular motion to the front as you exhale and flex your pecs. Hold the contraction for a second. Slowly return to the starting position as you inhale. Perform for the recommended amount of repetitions."
