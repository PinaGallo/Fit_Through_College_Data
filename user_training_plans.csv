PinaG,2024-05-31,Monday,Dumbbell Lunges,beginner,quadriceps,Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides. This will be your starting position. Step forward with your right leg around 2 feet or so from the foot being left stationary behind and lower your upper body down while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: As in the other exercises do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Using mainly the heel of your foot push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Monday,Barbell Squat,beginner,quadriceps,This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it. Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section). Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
