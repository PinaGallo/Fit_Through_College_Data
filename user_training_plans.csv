PinaG,2024-05-31,Tuesday,Push Up to Side Plank,beginner,chest,Get into pushup position on the toes with your hands just outside of shoulder width. Perform a pushup by allowing the elbows to flex. As you descend keep your body straight. Do one pushup and as you come up shift your weight on the left side of the body twist to the side while bringing the right arm up towards the ceiling in a side plank. Lower the arm back to the floor for another pushup and then twist to the other side. Repeat the series alternating each side for 10 or more reps.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Tuesday,Single-Arm Cable Crossover,beginner,chest,Begin by moving the pulleys to the high position select the resistance to be used and take a handle in each hand. Step forward in front of both pulleys with your arms extended in front of you bringing your hands together. Your head and chest should be up as you lean forward while your feet should be staggered. This will be your starting position. Keeping your left arm in place allow your right arm to extend out to the side maintaining a slight bend at the elbow. The right arm should be perpendicular to the body at approximately shoulder level. Return your arm back to the starting position by pulling your hand back to the midline of the body. Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Continue alternating back and forth for the prescribed number of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Tuesday,Cable One Arm Tricep Extension,beginner,triceps,With your right hand grasp a single handle attached to the high-cable pulley using a supinated (underhand; palms facing up) grip. You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack. Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position. As you contract the triceps move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position. Slowly return the handle to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Tuesday,Cable Crossover,beginner,chest,To get yourself into the starting position place the pulleys on a high position (above your head) select the resistance to be used and hold the pulleys in each hand. Step forward in front of an imaginary straight line between both pulleys while pulling your arms together in front of you. Your torso should have a small forward bend from the waist. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon extend your arms to the side (straight out at both sides) in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement the arms and torso should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you breathe out. Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the starting position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-31,Tuesday,Extended Range One-Arm Kettlebell Floor Press,beginner,chest,Lie on the floor and position a kettlebell for one arm to press. The kettlebell should be held by the handle. The leg on the same side that you are pressing should be bent with the knee crossing over the midline of the body. Press the kettlebell by extending the elbow and adducting the arm pressing it above your body. Return to the starting position.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Thursday,Elbows Back,beginner,chest,Stand up straight. Place both hands on your lower back fingers pointing downward and elbows out. Then gently pull your elbows back aiming to touch them together.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Thursday,Push-Ups With Feet Elevated,beginner,chest,Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches apart from each other holding your torso up at arms length. Place your toes on top of a flat bench. This will allow your body to be elevated. Note: The higher the elevation of the flat bench the higher the resistance of the exercise is. Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. Using your pectoral muscles press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest. Breathe out as you perform this step. After a second pause at the contracted position repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Thursday,Supine Chest Throw,beginner,triceps,This drill is great for chest passes when you lack a partner or a wall of sufficient strength. Lay on the ground on your back with your knees bent. Begin with the ball on your chest held with both hands on the bottom. Explode up extending through the elbow to throw the ball directly above you as high as possible. Catch the ball with both hands as it comes down.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Thursday,Cable Rope Overhead Triceps Extension,beginner,triceps,Attach a rope to the bottom pulley of the pulley machine. Grasping the rope with both hands extend your arms with your hands directly above your head using a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Your elbows should be in close to your head and the arms should be perpendicular to the floor with the knuckles aimed at the ceiling. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower the rope behind your head as you hold the upper arms stationary. Inhale as you perform this movement and pause when your triceps are fully stretched. Return to the starting position by flexing your triceps as you breathe out. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-01,Thursday,Suspended Push-Up,beginner,chest,Anchor your suspension straps securely to the top of a rack or other object. Leaning into the straps take a handle in each hand and move into a push-up plank position. You should be as close to parallel to the ground as you can manage with your arms fully extended maintaining good posture. Maintaining a straight rigid torso descend slowly by allowing the elbows to flex. Continue until your elbows break 90 degrees pausing before you extend to return to the starting position.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,JM Press,beginner,triceps,Start the exercise the same way you would a close grip bench press. You will lie on a flat bench while holding a barbell at arms length (fully extended) with the elbows in. However instead of having the arms perpendicular to the torso make sure the bar is set in a direct line above the upper chest. This will be your starting position. Now beginning from a fully extended position lower the bar down as if performing a lying triceps extension. Inhale as you perform this movement. When you reach the half way point let the bar roll back about one inch by moving the upper arms towards your legs until they are perpendicular to the torso. Tip: Keep the bend at the elbows constant as you bring the upper arms forward. As you exhale press the bar back up by using the triceps to perform a close grip bench press. Now go back to the starting position and start over. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,Incline Dumbbell Bench With Palms Facing In,beginner,chest,Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell on each hand on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. By using your thighs to help you get the dumbbells up clean the dumbbells one arm at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width keep the palms of your hands with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Keep your elbows flared out with the upper arms in line with the shoulders (perpendicular to the torso) and the elbows bent creating a 90-degree angle between the upper arm and the forearm. This will be your starting position. Now bring down the weights slowly to your side as you breathe in. Keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. As you breathe out push the dumbbells up using your pectoral muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position hold for a second and then start coming down slowly. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done place the dumbbells back in your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to dispose of the dumbbells.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,Incline Dumbbell Flyes,beginner,chest,Hold a dumbbell on each hand and lie on an incline bench that is set to an incline angle of no more than 30 degrees. Extend your arms above you with a slight bend at the elbows. Now rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing you. Tip: The pinky fingers should be next to each other. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in start to slowly lower the arms to the side while keeping the arms extended and while rotating the wrists until the palms of the hand are facing each other. Tip: At the end of the movement the arms will be by your side with the palms facing the ceiling. As you exhale start to bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion and rotating the hands so that the pinky fingers are next to each other again. Tip: Keep in mind that the movement will only happen at the shoulder joint and at the wrist. There is no motion that happens at the elbow joint. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,Low Cable Triceps Extension,beginner,triceps,Select the desired weight and lay down face up on the bench of a seated row machine that has a rope attached to it. Your head should be pointing towards the attachment. Grab the outside of the rope ends with your palms facing each other (neutral grip). Position your elbows so that they are bent at a 90 degree angle and your upper arms are perpendicular (90 degree angle) to your torso. Tip: Keep the elbows in and make sure that the upper arms point to the ceiling while your forearms point towards the pulley above your head. This will be your starting position. As you breathe out extend your lower arms until they are straight and vertical. The upper arms and elbows remain stationary throughout the movement. Only the forearms should move. Contract the triceps hard for a second. As you breathe in slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-06-02,Friday,Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment,beginner,triceps,Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position. Using the triceps bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After holding for a second at the contracted position bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
