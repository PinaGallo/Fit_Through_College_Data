Maximus,2024-05-08,Saturday,Sandbag Load,beginner,quadriceps,"To load sandbags or other objects begin with the implements placed a distance from the loading platform typically 50 feet. Begin by lifting the sandbag. Sandbags are extremely awkward and the manner of lifting them can vary depending on the particular sandbag used. Reach as far around it as possible extending through the hips and knees to pull it up high. Shouldering is usually not allowed. ""Move as quickly as possible to the platform and load it extending through your hips knees and ankles to get it as high as possible. Place it onto the platform ensuring it doesnt fall off."" Return to the starting position to retrieve the next sandbag and repeat until the event is completed."

Maximus,2024-05-08,Saturday,Low Pulley Row To Neck,beginner,shoulders,Sit on a low pulley row machine with a rope attachment. Grab the ends of the rope using a palms-down grip and sit with your back straight and your knees slightly bent. Tip: Keep your back almost completely vertical and your arms fully extended in front of you. This will be your starting position. While keeping your torso stationary lift your elbows and start bending them as you pull the rope towards your neck while exhaling. Throughout the movement your upper arms should remain parallel to the floor. Tip: Continue this motion until your hands are almost next to your ears (the forearms will not be parallel to the floor at the end of the movement as they will be angled a bit upwards) and your elbows are out away from your sides. After holding for a second or so at the contracted position come back slowly to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Again during no part of the movement should the torso move. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
