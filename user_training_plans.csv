PinaG,2024-05-25,Friday,Concentration Curls,beginner,biceps,Sit down on a flat bench with one dumbbell in front of you between your legs. Your legs should be spread with your knees bent and feet on the floor. Use your right arm to pick the dumbbell up. Place the back of your right upper arm on the top of your inner right thigh. Rotate the palm of your hand until it is facing forward away from your thigh. Tip: Your arm should be extended and the dumbbell should be above the floor. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arm stationary curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Tip: At the top of the movement make sure that the little finger of your arm is higher than your thumb. This guarantees a good contraction. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Caution: Avoid swinging motions at any time. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Then repeat the movement with the left arm.
PinaG,2024-05-25,Friday,Alternate Hammer Curl,beginner,biceps,Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arm stationary curl the right weight forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Continue the movement until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back to starting position as your breathe in. Repeat the movement with the left hand. This equals one repetition. Continue alternating in this manner for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-25,Friday,Cross Body Hammer Curl,beginner,biceps,Stand up straight with a dumbbell in each hand. Your hands should be down at your side with your palms facing in. While keeping your palms facing in and without twisting your arm curl the dumbbell of the right arm up towards your left shoulder as you exhale. Touch the top of the dumbbell to your shoulder and hold the contraction for a second. Slowly lower the dumbbell along the same path as you inhale and then repeat the same movement for the left arm. Continue alternating in this fashion until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed for each arm.
PinaG,2024-05-25,Friday,Lying Supine Dumbbell Curl,beginner,biceps,Lie down on a flat bench face up while holding a dumbbell in each arm on top of your thighs. Bring the dumbbells to the sides with the arms extended and the palms of the hands facing your thighs (neutral grip). While keeping the arms close to your torso and elbows in slowly lower your arms (as you keep them extended with a slight bend at the elbows) as far down towards the floor as you can go. Once you cannot go down any further lock your upper arms in that position and that will be your starting position. As you breathe out slowly begin to curl the weights up as you simultaneously rotate your wrists so that the palms of the hands face up. Continue curling the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and squeeze hard at the top position for a second. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Upper arms should remain stationary and elbows should stay in throughout the movement. Return back to the starting position very slowly.
PinaG,2024-05-25,Friday,One Arm Dumbbell Preacher Curl,beginner,biceps,Grab a dumbbell with the right arm and place the upper arm on top of the preacher bench or the incline bench. The dumbbell should be held at shoulder length. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in slowly lower the dumbbell until your upper arm is extended and the biceps is fully stretched. As you exhale use the biceps to curl the weight up until your biceps is fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder height. Again remember that to ensure full contraction you need to bring that small finger higher than the thumb. Squeeze the biceps hard for a second at the contracted position and repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the movement.
