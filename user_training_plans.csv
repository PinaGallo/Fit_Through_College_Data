PinaG,2024-05-28,Saturday,Hip Lift with Band,beginner,glutes,"""After choosing a suitable band lay down in the middle of the rack after securing the band on either side of you. If your rack doesnt have pegs the band can be secured using heavy dumbbells or similar objects just ensure they wont move."" Adjust your position so that the band is directly over your hips. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor. Your hands can be on the floor or holding the band in position. Keeping your shoulders on the ground drive through your heels to raise your hips pushing into the band as high as you can. Pause at the top of the motion and return to the starting position."
PinaG,2024-05-28,Saturday,Glute Kickback,beginner,glutes,Kneel on the floor or an exercise mat and bend at the waist with your arms extended in front of you (perpendicular to the torso) in order to get into a kneeling push-up position but with the arms spaced at shoulder width. Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position. As you exhale lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it. Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg. Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.
PinaG,2024-05-28,Saturday,Hip Extension with Bands,beginner,glutes,Secure one end of the band to the lower portion of a post and attach the other to one ankle. Facing the attachment point of the band hold on to the column to stabilize yourself. Keeping your head and your chest up move the resisted leg back as far as you can while keeping the knee straight. Return the leg to the starting position.
PinaG,2024-05-28,Saturday,Pull Through,beginner,glutes,Begin standing a few feet in front of a low pulley with a rope or handle attached. Face away from the machine straddling the cable with your feet set wide apart. Begin the movement by reaching through your legs as far as possible bending at the hips. Keep your knees slightly bent. Keeping your arms straight extend through the hip to stand straight up. Avoid pulling upward through the shoulders; all of the motion should originate through the hips.
PinaG,2024-05-28,Saturday,Step-up with Knee Raise,beginner,glutes,Stand facing a box or bench of an appropriate height with your feet together. This will be your starting position. Begin the movement by stepping up putting your left foot on the top of the bench. Extend through the hip and knee of your front leg to stand up on the box. As you stand on the box with your left leg flex your right knee and hip bringing your knee as high as you can. Reverse this motion to step down off the box and then repeat the sequence on the opposite leg.
