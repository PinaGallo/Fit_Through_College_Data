PinaG,2024-05-20,Friday,Child's Pose,beginner,lower back,"Get on your hands and knees walk your hands in front of you. Lower your buttocks down to sit on your heels. Let your arms drag along the floor as you sit back to stretch your entire spine. Once you settle onto your heels bring your hands next to your feet and relax. ""breathe"" into your back. Rest your forehead on the floor. Avoid this position if you have knee problems."
PinaG,2024-05-20,Friday,Pyramid,beginner,lower back,Start off by rolling your torso forward onto the ball so your hips rest on top of the ball and become the highest point of your body. Rest your hands and feet on the floor. Your arms and legs can be slightly bent or straight depending on the size of the ball your flexibility and the length of your limbs. This also helps develop stabilizing strength in your torso and shoulders.
PinaG,2024-05-20,Friday,Hyperextensions (Back Extensions),beginner,lower back,Lie face down on a hyperextension bench tucking your ankles securely under the footpads. Adjust the upper pad if possible so your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad leaving enough room for you to bend at the waist without any restriction. With your body straight cross your arms in front of you (my preference) or behind your head. This will be your starting position. Tip: You can also hold a weight plate for extra resistance in front of you under your crossed arms. Start bending forward slowly at the waist as far as you can while keeping your back flat. Inhale as you perform this movement. Keep moving forward until you feel a nice stretch on the hamstrings and you can no longer keep going without a rounding of the back. Tip: Never round the back as you perform this exercise. Also some people can go farther than others. The key thing is that you go as far as your body allows you to without rounding the back. Slowly raise your torso back to the initial position as you inhale. Tip: Avoid the temptation to arch your back past a straight line. Also do not swing the torso at any time in order to protect the back from injury. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
PinaG,2024-05-20,Friday,Superman,beginner,lower back,To begin lie straight and face down on the floor or exercise mat. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you. This is the starting position. Simultaneously raise your arms legs and chest off of the floor and hold this contraction for 2 seconds. Tip: Squeeze your lower back to get the best results from this exercise. Remember to exhale during this movement. Note: When holding the contracted position you should look like superman when he is flying. Slowly begin to lower your arms legs and chest back down to the starting position while inhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions prescribed in your program.
PinaG,2024-05-20,Friday,Hug A Ball,beginner,lower back,"Seat yourself on the floor. Straddle an exercise ball between both legs and lower your hips down toward the floor. ""Hug your arms around the ball to support your body. Adjust your legs so that your feet are flat on the floor and your knees line up over your ankles. Keep a good grip on the ball so it doesnt roll away from you and send you back onto your buttocks."""
